# Pressure Loss Calculator Tool - Matlab
A Matlab tool calculating the friction pressure loss in circular pipes with full flow water. This Matlab tool has the options in selecting the solver type through the equations either by 'Darcy-Weisbach' or by 'Hazen-Williams'. Besides, another feature in the tool options allows users to select through various algorithms to calculate the Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient *f*, limited to algorithms by 'Moody', 'Colebrook-White', 'Clamond', 'Swamee-Jain', 'Zigrang-Sylvester', and 'Haaland'. Two other converter tools are also given to obtain the Hazen-Williams roughness coefficient *C*, one from the absolute roughness of the pipe (also known as Îµ - eps) and the other from the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor *f*.
