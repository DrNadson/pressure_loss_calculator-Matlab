# Pressure Loss Calculator Tool - Matlab
A Matlab tool calculating the friction pressure loss in circular pipes with full flow water. 

## Features
- This Matlab tool has the options in selecting the solver type through the equations either by 'Darcy-Weisbach' or by 'Hazen-Williams'. 
- Besides, another feature in the tool options allows users to select through various algorithms to calculate the Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient *f*, limited to algorithms by 'Moody', 'Colebrook-White', 'Clamond', 'Swamee-Jain', 'Zigrang-Sylvester', and 'Haaland'. 
- Aside from the main Matlab tool, two other converter tools are also given to obtain the Hazen-Williams roughness coefficient *C*, one from the absolute roughness of the pipe (also known as ε - eps) and the other from the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor *f*, SO not a constant *C* anymore.

This Matlab tool is a by-product from the PhD study about the 4th generation (4G) low-temperature district heating systems in supply to low-energy houses, carried out by Hakan İbrahim Tol (PhD) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Svend Svendsen and Ass. Prof. Susanne Balslev Nielsen at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
